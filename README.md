# BookStore

## Considerations
1. An MVVM pattern, as well as separation of the data and domain layers.
2. SwiftUI Framework. 
3. MOCK API uses .txt resource files (not all detail mocks have been added)
4. All view states (error, empty state, loading) are handled.
5. Create item functionality has not been developed.
